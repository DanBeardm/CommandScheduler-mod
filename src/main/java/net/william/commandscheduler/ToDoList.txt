 FUNCTIONALITY AND OTHER NOTES:

 I have tested everything and confirmed functionality for 1.20.2 for both singleplayer and for servers! The only 
 quirk for singleplayer being that it seems that the atboot commands only runs the first time on that runtime. 
 If you leave, wait and then rejoin, it does NOT send a new atboot command. If you however restart your game,
 it does successfully send a new atboot command.

 I also tested singleplayer functionality for 1.21.4 and everything did seem to work. It is likely it will be fully
 compatible for 1.21.5 however I must first test multiplayer functionality before being sure.

 I tested singleplayer functionality for 1.19.2 and it did boot, schedulers successfully ran and all logic
 seemed to work, although it seems that printouts don't really work. When for example running "/commandscheduler help"
 absolutely nothing shows. This is likely related to how 1.19 handles ServerCommandSource.sendFeedback().

 This likely means that the mod 1.0 version will initially only be made for versions between 1.20 and 1.21.5.
 I might at a later date make a new repository to adapt the 1.0 version for older versions, unless I start
 working on version 1.1 of the mod first. We'll see.


 FOR UPCOMING VERSIONs:

 ‚ùå /commandscheduler new singlefire <id> <date> <time> <command> - A new type of scheduler! Fire the command once on a specific time stamp, and then delete itself. Requires new config file.
 
 ‚ùå /commandscheduler list singlefire - These should have pages! 

 ‚ùå /commandscheduler addcommand <id> <command> - The ability to have multiple commands run after each other on the same scheduler!
 ‚ùå /commandscheduler removecommand <index> - Removes a command from a scheduler
    ^ Implementing these also means we have to remove the <command> section entirely from the command to create any new scheduler. 
      This also makes it so the constructors need to be reworked, as they need a <command>...
      The removecommand could also give a confirmation like "Are you sure you want to remove this command: [show command]"

 üí° /commandscheduler details <id> - Already exists, but modify to nicely list all commands, with an associated number to simplify removing them
