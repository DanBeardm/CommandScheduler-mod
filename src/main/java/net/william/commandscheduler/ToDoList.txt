 ❌ /commandscheduler singlefire [id] [date] [time] [command] - A new type of scheduler! Fire the command once on a specific time stamp, and then delete itself. Requires new config file.
 
 ❌ /commandscheduler list singlefire - These should have pages! 

 ❌ /commandscheduler addcommand [id] <command> - The ability to have multiple commands run after each other on the same scheduler!
