# Command Scheduler (Fabric 1.20.2)

A Minecraft Fabric mod for schedulable and repeatable commands ‚Äî made for 1.20.2.  
Created by Poizon.

## MOD IS NOT YET FINISHED:
The mod works, but it's not yet really playtested and I still plan on adding a couple of commands. There are example commands set and you can activate, deactivate and rename using commands, however I have not yet added a way of scheduling new commands. This currently has to be done using the config files, although it's not very difficult. For a checklist of currently implemented commands, check [this file](src/main/java/net/william/commandscheduler/commands_to_add.txt).

## What it does

This simple mod lets any OP on a server schedule commands to run automatically.  
You can schedule:

- Repeating commands on an interval (e.g., every 10 seconds)
- Commands at specific times (e.g., at 00:00 every day)
- One-time commands that run at server startup

## About

This is my first ever Minecraft mod! I made it for my own server, and I rushed through some parts to get it functional quickly ‚Äî but added some helpful tools, command structure, and clean formatting to make it feel smooth.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: 99% of the code was written by ChatGPT, under my constant guidance and review. I do know Java quite well but wanted it done quickly. Think of it as AI-assisted but user-shaped.
